# tilelive.js

tilelive.js is an interface for tilestore modules for [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). It defines an [API](https://github.com/mapbox/tilelive.js/blob/master/API.md) to interact with implementations for a particular tile store.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mapbox/tilelive.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mapbox/tilelive.js)

## Backends

- [MBTiles](https://github.com/mapbox/node-mbtiles)
- [TileJSON](https://github.com/mapbox/node-tilejson)
- [Mapnik](https://github.com/mapbox/tilelive-mapnik)

## Usage

Tilelive doesn't ship with any Tilestore backends by default. To use a particular backend, register it with tilelive using `require('[implementation]').registerProtocols(tilelive);`.

* `tilelive.list(source, callback)`: Lists all tilesets in a directory. `source` is a folder that is used by registered implementations to search for individual tilesets. `callback` receives an error object (or `null`) and a hash hash with keys being Tilestore IDs and values being Tilestore URIs. Example:

```javascript
{
    "world-light": "mbtiles:///path/to/file/world-light.mbtiles",
    "mapquest": "tilejson:///path/to/file/mapquest.tilejson"
}
```

* `tilelive.findID(source, id, callback)`: Looks for a particular tileset ID in a directory. `callback` receives an error object (or `null`) and the URI of the tileset.


* `tilelive.load(uri, callback)`: Loads the Tilestore object associated with the specified `uri`. `callback` receives an error object (or `null`) and the Tilestore object.

* `tilelive.info(uri, callback)`: Loads the Tilestore object associated with the specified `uri` and retrieves its metadata in a [TileJSON](http://github.com/mapbox/tilejson) compliant format. `callback` receives an error object (or `null`), the metadata hash and the Tilestore object.

* `tilelive.all(source, callback)`: Loads metadata in a [TileJSON](http://github.com/mapbox/tilejson) compliant format for all tilesets in the `source` directory. `callback` receives an error object (or `null`) and an array with TileJSON metadata about each tileset in that directory.


* `tilelive.verify(tilejson)`: Validates a TileJSON object and returns error objects for invalid entries.

* `tilelive.copy(args, callback)`: Copies data from one tilestore into another tilestore. `args` is a configuration hash with these keys:

  * `source`: a Tilestore object that implements the Tilesource interface
  * `sink`: a Tilestore object that implements the Tilesink interface
  * `bbox`: an array with W/S/E/N boundaries in WGS84 format (-180...180, -90...90)
  * `minZoom`: the minimum zoom for data to be copied (inclusive)
  * `maxZoom`: the maximum zoom for data to be copied (inclusive)
  * `concurrency`: (default: `100`) how many data objects should be copied simultaneously.
  * `callback`: (optional) called when copying is complete
  * `tiles`: copy tiles (`true` or `false`)
  * `grids`: copy grids (`true` or `false`)

  This function returns an EventEmitter that has these events emitted:

  * `warning`: An error occurred during copying. `err` is the first argument.
  * `error`: An error occured while initializing the tilesource/tilesink.
  * `finished`: Copying completed

  The EventEmitter also has these properties. They are updated continuously while copying. Check them occassionally to report status to the user.

  * `copied`: Number of elements that have been copied so far
  * `failed`: Number of elements that couldn't be copied.
  * `total`: Total number of elements to be copied.
  * `started`: Timestamp of when the action started in milliseconds after epoch

## bin/copy

tilelive can be used to copy data between tilestores. For a full list of options, run `bin/copy`.

## Tests

To run the tests

    npm test

## Usage

See `examples` for examples of a tilelive powered server.
